Goal: Find shortest path to every atom.

Command synonyms -- merge similar commands
Explore new areas
Score heuristic

Pick command that has highest probability of generating most uncommon atom.

When atom generated anew or earlier than before, record data:
- first turn #
- command
- prior atoms

(command, runs)
(command, generated, prior, count)

Find command that generates low score token with current priors.
Execute, update stats.

Run command eagerly, fails due to priors.
Update stats, run later.


APPROACH

First, start with randomly-walking commands.

A random command is a series of words (N=2 currently) from the game's vocab
file.

There is a random (0.5) chance that a word is from recently-seen vocab
words.

We record the transcript for each playthrough.

We add tokens to a sorted list, associated with the playthrough that
generated them. The shortest playthrough is recorded.

Each run has a "goal token" that we try to recreate.

When we rerun a playthrough, we pick commands out-of-order.

If the tokens we see don't change from play to play, we increment the
"stable" counter.

When a goal token is more stable, we shuffle less often and just replay in
order.
